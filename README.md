In Cavern Cookeries, you control a young chef exploring a dangerous cavern full of edible monsters! You seek the legendary dragon residing in the cavern and are eager to use its delicious meat for an amazing meal to prove to your mentor that you are worthy of becoming a Master Chef. However, it would be wise to explore the cavern fully and see what other goodies these monsters drop...

This text-based game allows the Player to explore three different levels of the cavern, where they can battle monsters, collect dropped food items, and create a delicious meal at the end.
